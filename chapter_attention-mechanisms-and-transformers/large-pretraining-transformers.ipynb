    "# Large-Scale Pretraining with Transformers\n",
    ":label:`sec_large-pretraining-transformers`\n",
    "\n",
    "So far in our image classification and machine translation experiments,\n",
    "models have been trained on datasets with input--output examples\n",
    "*from scratch* to perform specific tasks.\n",
    "For example, a Transformer was trained\n",
    "with English--French pairs (:numref:`sec_transformer`)\n",
    "so that this model can translate input English text into French.\n",
    "As a result, each model becomes a *specific expert*\n",
    "that is sensitive to even a slight shift in data distribution\n",
    "(:numref:`sec_environment-and-distribution-shift`).\n",
    "For better generalized models, or even more competent *generalists*\n",
    "that can perform multiple tasks with or without adaptation,\n",
    "*pretraining* models on large data has been increasingly common.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given larger data for pretraining, the Transformer architecture\n",
    "performs better with an increased model size and training compute,\n",

    "scales as a power law with the amount of model parameters,\n",
    "training tokens, and training compute :cite:`kaplan2020scaling`.\n",
    "The scalability of Transformers is also evidenced\n",
    "by the significantly boosted performance\n",
    "from larger vision Transformers trained on larger data\n",
    "(discussed in :numref:`sec_vision-transformer`).\n",
    "More recent success stories include Gato, a *generalist* model\n",
    "that can play Atari, caption images, chat, and act as a robot :cite:`reed2022generalist`. Gato is a single  Transformer that scales well when pretrained on diverse modalities,\n",
    "including text, images, joint torques, and button presses.\n",
    "Notably, all such multimodal data is serialized into a flat sequence of tokens,\n",
    "which can be processed akin to text tokens (:numref:`sec_transformer`)\n",
    "or image patches (:numref:`sec_vision-transformer`) by Transformers.\n",

    "Transformers were extensively pretrained  with a wealth of text.\n",
    "Originally proposed for machine translation,\n",
    "the Transformer architecture in :numref:`fig_transformer`\n",
    "consists of an encoder for representing input sequences\n",
    "and a decoder for generating target sequences.\n",
    "Primarily, Transformers can be used in three different modes:\n",
    "*encoder-only*, *encoder--decoder*, and *decoder-only*.\n",
    "To conclude this chapter, we will review these three modes\n",

    "where all input tokens attend to each other.\n",
    "For example, vision Transformers depicted in :numref:`fig_vit`\n",

    "Note that there is no constraint in the attention pattern of Transformer encoders\n",
    "(right of :numref:`fig_bert-encoder-only`)\n",

    "\n",
    "The pretrained BERT can be *fine-tuned* to downstream encoding tasks involving single text or text pairs.

    "## Summary and Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "Transformers have been pretrained as encoder-only (e.g., BERT), encoder--decoder (e.g., T5), and decoder-only (e.g., GPT series). Pretrained models may be adapted to perform different tasks with model update (e.g., fine-tuning) or not (e.g., few-shot). Scalability of Transformers suggests that better performance benefits from larger models, more training data, and more training compute. Since Transformers were first designed and pretrained for text data, this section leans slightly towards natural language processing. Nonetheless, those models discussed above can be often found in more recent models across multiple modalities. For example,\n",
    "(i) Chinchilla :cite:`hoffmann2022training` was further extended to Flamingo :cite:`alayrac2022flamingo`, a visual language model for few-shot learning;\n",
    "(ii) GPT-2 :cite:`Radford.Wu.Child.ea.2019` and the vision Transformer encode text and images in CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) :cite:`radford2021learning`, whose image and text embeddings were later adopted in the DALL-E 2 text-to-image system :cite:`ramesh2022hierarchical`. Although there have been no systematic studies on Transformer scalability in multimodal pretraining yet, an all-Transformer text-to-image model called Parti :cite:`yu2022scaling` shows potential of scalability across modalities:\n",

    "1. Say that you are asked to fine-tune a language model to perform text classification by adding additional layers. Where will you add them? Why?\n",
    "1. Consider sequence-to-sequence problems (e.g., machine translation) where the input sequence is always available throughout the target sequence prediction. What could be limitations of modeling with decoder-only Transformers? Why?\n",
