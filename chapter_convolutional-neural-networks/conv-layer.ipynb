    "Based on our descriptions of convolutional layers in :numref:`sec_why-conv`,\n",

    "with a height of 3 and width of 3.\n",
    "We mark the shape of the tensor as $3 \\times 3$ or ($3$, $3$).\n",
    "The height and width of the kernel are both 2.\n",
    "The shape of the *kernel window* (or *convolution window*)\n",
    "is given by the height and width of the kernel\n",

    "When the convolution window slides to a certain position,\n",

    "This result gives the value of the output tensor\n",
    "at the corresponding location.\n",
    "Here, the output tensor has a height of 2 and width of 2\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* The core computation of a two-dimensional convolutional layer is a two-dimensional cross-correlation operation. In its simplest form, this performs a cross-correlation operation on the two-dimensional input data and the kernel, and then adds a bias.\n",
    "* We can design a kernel to detect edges in images.\n",
    "* We can learn the kernel's parameters from data.\n",
    "* With kernels learned from data, the outputs of convolutional layers remain unaffected regardless of such layers' performed operations (either strict convolution or cross-correlation).\n",
    "* When any element in a feature map needs a larger receptive field to detect broader features on the input, a deeper network can be considered.\n",
