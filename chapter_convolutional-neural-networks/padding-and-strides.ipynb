    "## Summary and Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "Padding can increase the height and width of the output. This is often used to give the output the same height and width as the input to avoid undesirable shrinkage of the output. Moreover, it ensures that all pixels are used equally frequently. Typically we pick symmetric padding on both sides of the input height and width. In this case we refer to $(p_\\textrm{h}, p_\\textrm{w})$ padding. Most commonly we set $p_\\textrm{h} = p_\\textrm{w}$, in which case we simply state that we choose padding $p$. \n",
    "\n",
    "A similar convention applies to strides. When horizontal stride $s_\\textrm{h}$ and vertical stride $s_\\textrm{w}$ match, we simply talk about stride $s$. The stride can reduce the resolution of the output, for example reducing the height and width of the output to only $1/n$ of the height and width of the input for $n > 1$. By default, the padding is 0 and the stride is 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "So far all padding that we discussed simply extended images with zeros. This has significant computational benefit since it is trivial to accomplish. Moreover, operators can be engineered to take advantage of this padding implicitly without the need to allocate additional memory. At the same time, it allows CNNs to encode implicit position information within an image, simply by learning where the \"whitespace\" is. There are many alternatives to zero-padding. :citet:`Alsallakh.Kokhlikyan.Miglani.ea.2020` provided an extensive overview of those (albeit without a clear case for when to use nonzero paddings unless artifacts occur). \n",
    "\n",

    "   calculate the output shape to check if it is consistent with the experimental result.\n",
    "1. For audio signals, what does a stride of 2 correspond to?\n",
    "1. Implement mirror padding, i.e., padding where the border values are simply mirrored to extend tensors. \n",
    "1. What are the computational benefits of a stride larger than 1?\n",
    "1. What might be statistical benefits of a stride larger than 1?\n",
    "1. How would you implement a stride of $\\frac{1}{2}$? What does it correspond to? When would this be useful?\n"
