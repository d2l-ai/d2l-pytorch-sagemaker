    "# Padding and Stride\n",
    ":label:`sec_padding`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous example of :numref:`fig_correlation`,\n",
    "our input had both a height and width of 3\n",
    "and our convolution kernel had both a height and width of 2,\n",
    "yielding an output representation with dimension $2\\times2$.\n",
    "As we generalized in :numref:`sec_conv_layer`,\n",
    "assuming that\n",
    "the input shape is $n_h\\times n_w$\n",
    "and the convolution kernel shape is $k_h\\times k_w$,\n",
    "then the output shape will be\n",
    "$(n_h-k_h+1) \\times (n_w-k_w+1)$.\n",
    "Therefore, the output shape of the convolutional layer\n",
    "is determined by the shape of the input\n",
    "and the shape of the convolution kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "In several cases, we incorporate techniques,\n",
    "including padding and strided convolutions,\n",
    "that affect the size of the output.\n",
    "As motivation, note that since kernels generally\n",
    "have width and height greater than $1$,\n",
    "after applying many successive convolutions,\n",
    "we tend to wind up with outputs that are\n",
    "considerably smaller than our input.\n",
    "If we start with a $240 \\times 240$ pixel image,\n",
    "$10$ layers of $5 \\times 5$ convolutions\n",
    "reduce the image to $200 \\times 200$ pixels,\n",
    "slicing off $30 \\%$ of the image and with it\n",
    "obliterating any interesting information\n",
    "on the boundaries of the original image.\n",
    "*Padding* is the most popular tool for handling this issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other cases, we may want to reduce the dimensionality drastically,\n",
    "e.g., if we find the original input resolution to be unwieldy.\n",
    "*Strided convolutions* are a popular technique that can help in these instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Padding\n",
    "\n",
    "As described above, one tricky issue when applying convolutional layers\n",
    "is that we tend to lose pixels on the perimeter of our image.\n",
    "Since we typically use small kernels,\n",
    "for any given convolution,\n",
    "we might only lose a few pixels,\n",
    "but this can add up as we apply\n",
    "many successive convolutional layers.\n",
    "One straightforward solution to this problem\n",
    "is to add extra pixels of filler around the boundary of our input image,\n",
    "thus increasing the effective size of the image.\n",
    "Typically, we set the values of the extra pixels to zero.\n",
    "In :numref:`img_conv_pad`, we pad a $3 \\times 3$ input,\n",
    "increasing its size to $5 \\times 5$.\n",
    "The corresponding output then increases to a $4 \\times 4$ matrix.\n",
    "The shaded portions are the first output element as well as the input and kernel tensor elements used for the output computation: $0\\times0+0\\times1+0\\times2+0\\times3=0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Two-dimensional cross-correlation with padding.](../img/conv-pad.svg)\n",
    ":label:`img_conv_pad`\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, if we add a total of $p_h$ rows of padding\n",
    "(roughly half on top and half on bottom)\n",
    "and a total of $p_w$ columns of padding\n",
    "(roughly half on the left and half on the right),\n",
    "the output shape will be\n",
    "\n",
    "$$(n_h-k_h+p_h+1)\\times(n_w-k_w+p_w+1).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the height and width of the output\n",
    "will increase by $p_h$ and $p_w$, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many cases, we will want to set $p_h=k_h-1$ and $p_w=k_w-1$\n",
    "to give the input and output the same height and width.\n",
    "This will make it easier to predict the output shape of each layer\n",
    "when constructing the network.\n",
    "Assuming that $k_h$ is odd here,\n",
    "we will pad $p_h/2$ rows on both sides of the height.\n",
    "If $k_h$ is even, one possibility is to\n",
    "pad $\\lceil p_h/2\\rceil$ rows on the top of the input\n",
    "and $\\lfloor p_h/2\\rfloor$ rows on the bottom.\n",
    "We will pad both sides of the width in the same way.\n",
    "\n",
    "CNNs commonly use convolution kernels\n",
    "with odd height and width values, such as 1, 3, 5, or 7.\n",
    "Choosing odd kernel sizes has the benefit\n",
    "that we can preserve the spatial dimensionality\n",
    "while padding with the same number of rows on top and bottom,\n",
    "and the same number of columns on left and right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, this practice of using odd kernels\n",
    "and padding to precisely preserve dimensionality\n",
    "offers a clerical benefit.\n",
    "For any two-dimensional tensor `X`,\n",
    "when the kernel's size is odd\n",
    "and the number of padding rows and columns\n",
    "on all sides are the same,\n",
    "producing an output with the same height and width as the input,\n",
    "we know that the output `Y[i, j]` is calculated\n",
    "by cross-correlation of the input and convolution kernel\n",
    "with the window centered on `X[i, j]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following example, we create a two-dimensional convolutional layer\n",
    "with a height and width of 3\n",
    "and apply 1 pixel of padding on all sides.\n",
    "Given an input with a height and width of 8,\n",
    "we find that the height and width of the output is also 8.\n"
