    "then when $c_i=1$, we can think of our convolution kernel\n",
    "as just a two-dimensional tensor of shape $k_h\\times k_w$.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when $c_i>1$, we need a kernel\n",
    "that contains a tensor of shape $k_h\\times k_w$ for *every* input channel. Concatenating these $c_i$ tensors together\n",
    "yields a convolution kernel of shape $c_i\\times k_h\\times k_w$.\n",
    "Since the input and convolution kernel each have $c_i$ channels,\n",
    "we can perform a cross-correlation operation\n",
    "on the two-dimensional tensor of the input\n",
    "and the two-dimensional tensor of the convolution kernel\n",
    "for each channel, adding the $c_i$ results together\n",
    "(summing over the channels)\n",
    "to yield a two-dimensional tensor.\n",

    "Note, though, that this flexibility comes at a price. Given an image of size $(h \\times w)$, the cost for computing a $k \\times k$ convolution is $O(h \\cdot w \\cdot k^2)$. For $c_i$ and $c_o$ input and output channels respectively this increases to $O(h \\cdot w \\cdot k^2 \\cdot c_i \\cdot c_o)$. For a $256 \\times 256$ pixel image with a $5 \\times 5$ kernel and $128$ input and output channels respectively this amounts to over 53 billion operations (we count multiplications and additions separately). Later on we will encounter effective strategies to cut down on the cost, e.g., by requiring the channel-wise operations to be block-diagonal, leading to architectures such as ResNeXt :cite:`Xie.Girshick.Dollar.ea.2017`. \n",

    "\n",
    "1. Assume that we have two convolution kernels of size $k_1$ and $k_2$, respectively \n",
    "   (with no nonlinearity in-between).\n",
    "    1. Prove that the result of the operation can be expressed by a single convolution.\n",
    "    1. What is the dimensionality of the equivalent single convolution?\n",
    "    1. Is the converse true, i.e., can you always decompose a convolution into two smaller ones?\n",
    "1. Assume an input of shape $c_i\\times h\\times w$ and a convolution kernel of shape \n",
    "   $c_o\\times c_i\\times k_h\\times k_w$, padding of $(p_h, p_w)$, and stride of $(s_h, s_w)$.\n",
    "    1. What is the computational cost (multiplications and additions) for the forward propagation?\n",
    "    1. What is the memory footprint?\n",
    "    1. What is the memory footprint for the backward computation?\n",
    "    1. What is the computational cost for the backpropagation?\n",
    "1. By what factor does the number of calculations increase if we double the number of input channels \n",
    "   $c_i$ and the number of output channels $c_o$? What happens if we double the padding?\n",
    "1. Are the variables `Y1` and `Y2` in the last example of this section exactly the same? Why?\n",
    "1. Express convolutions as a matrix multiplication, even when the convolution window is not $1 \\times 1$? \n",
    "1. Your task is to implement fast convolutions with a $k \\times k$ kernel. One of the algorithm candidates \n",
    "   is to scan horizontally across the source, reading a $k$-wide strip and computing the $1$-wide output strip \n",
    "   one value at a time. The alternative is to read a $k + \\Delta$ wide strip and compute a $\\Delta$-wide \n",
    "   output strip. Why is the latter preferable? Is there a limit to how large you should choose $\\Delta$?\n",
    "1. Assume that we have a $c \\times c$ matrix. \n",
    "    1. How much faster is it to multiply with a block-diagonal matrix if the matrix is broken up into $b$ blocks?\n",
    "    1. What is the downside of having $b$ blocks? How could you fix it, at least partly?\n"
