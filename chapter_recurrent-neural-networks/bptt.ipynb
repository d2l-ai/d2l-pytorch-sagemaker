    "\n",
    "### Full Computation ### \n",
    "\n",
    "One idea might be to compute the full sum in :eqref:`eq_bptt_partial_ht_wh_gen`.\n",
    "However, this is very slow and gradients can blow up,\n",
    "since subtle changes in the initial conditions\n",
    "can potentially affect the outcome a lot.\n",
    "That is, we could see things similar to the butterfly effect,\n",
    "where minimal changes in the initial conditions \n",
    "lead to disproportionate changes in the outcome.\n",
    "This is generally undesirable.\n",
    "After all, we are looking for robust estimators that generalize well. \n",
    "Hence this strategy is almost never used in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Truncating Time Steps###\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively,\n",
    "we can truncate the sum in\n",
    ":eqref:`eq_bptt_partial_ht_wh_gen`\n",
    "after $\\tau$ steps. \n",
    "This is what we have been discussing so far. \n",
    "This leads to an *approximation* of the true gradient,\n",
    "simply by terminating the sum at $\\partial h_{t-\\tau}/\\partial w_\\textrm{h}$. \n",
    "In practice this works quite well. \n",
    "It is what is commonly referred to as truncated \n",
    "backpropgation through time :cite:`Jaeger.2002`.\n",
    "One of the consequences of this is that the model \n",
    "focuses primarily on short-term influence \n",
    "rather than long-term consequences. \n",
    "This is actually *desirable*, since it biases the estimate \n",
    "towards simpler and more stable models.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Randomized Truncation ### \n",
    "\n",
    "Last, we can replace $\\partial h_t/\\partial w_\\textrm{h}$\n",
    "by a random variable which is correct in expectation \n",
    "but truncates the sequence.\n",
    "This is achieved by using a sequence of $\\xi_t$\n",
    "with predefined $0 \\leq \\pi_t \\leq 1$,\n",
    "where $P(\\xi_t = 0) = 1-\\pi_t$ and \n",
    "$P(\\xi_t = \\pi_t^{-1}) = \\pi_t$, thus $E[\\xi_t] = 1$.\n",
    "We use this to replace the gradient\n",
    "$\\partial h_t/\\partial w_\\textrm{h}$\n",
    "in :eqref:`eq_bptt_partial_ht_wh_recur`\n",
    "with\n",
    "\n",
    "$$z_t= \\frac{\\partial f(x_{t},h_{t-1},w_\\textrm{h})}{\\partial w_\\textrm{h}} +\\xi_t \\frac{\\partial f(x_{t},h_{t-1},w_\\textrm{h})}{\\partial h_{t-1}} \\frac{\\partial h_{t-1}}{\\partial w_\\textrm{h}}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It follows from the definition of $\\xi_t$ \n",
    "that $E[z_t] = \\partial h_t/\\partial w_\\textrm{h}$.\n",
    "Whenever $\\xi_t = 0$ the recurrent computation\n",
    "terminates at that time step $t$.\n",
    "This leads to a weighted sum of sequences of varying lengths,\n",
    "where long sequences are rare but appropriately overweighted. \n",
    "This idea was proposed by \n",
    ":citet:`Tallec.Ollivier.2017`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparing Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "![Comparing strategies for computing gradients in RNNs. From top to bottom: randomized truncation, regular truncation, and full computation.](../img/truncated-bptt.svg)\n",
    ":label:`fig_truncated_bptt`\n",

    ":numref:`fig_truncated_bptt` illustrates the three strategies \n",

    "* The first row is the randomized truncation that partitions the text into segments of varying lengths.\n",
    "* The second row is the regular truncation that breaks the text into subsequences of the same length. This is what we have been doing in RNN experiments.\n",

    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, while appealing in theory, \n",
    "randomized truncation does not work \n",
    "much better than regular truncation, \n",
    "most likely due to a number of factors.\n",
    "First, the effect of an observation\n",
    "after a number of backpropagation steps \n",
    "into the past is quite sufficient \n",
    "to capture dependencies in practice. \n",
    "Second, the increased variance counteracts the fact \n",
    "that the gradient is more accurate with more steps. \n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Backpropagation through time is merely an application of backpropagation to sequence models with a hidden state.\n",
    "Truncation, such as regular or randomized, is needed for computational convenience and numerical stability.\n",
    "High powers of matrices can lead to divergent or vanishing eigenvalues. This manifests itself in the form of exploding or vanishing gradients.\n",
    "For efficient computation, intermediate values are cached during backpropagation through time.\n",

    "## Exercises\n",

    "1. Assume that we have a symmetric matrix $\\mathbf{M} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ with eigenvalues $\\lambda_i$ whose corresponding eigenvectors are $\\mathbf{v}_i$ ($i = 1, \\ldots, n$). Without loss of generality, assume that they are ordered in the order $|\\lambda_i| \\geq |\\lambda_{i+1}|$. \n",
    "   1. Show that $\\mathbf{M}^k$ has eigenvalues $\\lambda_i^k$.\n",
    "   1. Prove that for a random vector $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, with high probability $\\mathbf{M}^k \\mathbf{x}$ will be very much aligned with the eigenvector $\\mathbf{v}_1$ \n",
    "of $\\mathbf{M}$. Formalize this statement.\n",
    "   1. What does the above result mean for gradients in RNNs?\n",
    "1. Besides gradient clipping, can you think of any other methods to cope with gradient explosion in recurrent neural networks?\n",
