    "datasets and models are usually large,\n",
    "which involves heavy computation.\n",
    "Therefore, computational performance matters a lot.\n",
    "This chapter will focus on the major factors that affect computational performance:\n",
    "imperative programming, symbolic programming, asynchronous computing, automatic parallelism, and multi-GPU computation.\n",
    "By studying this chapter, you may further improve computational performance of those models implemented in the previous chapters,\n",
    "for example, by reducing training time without affecting accuracy.\n",
