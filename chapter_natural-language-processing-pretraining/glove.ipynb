    "## The GloVe Model\n",
    "\n",
    "In view of this,\n",
    "the *GloVe* model makes three changes\n",
    "to the skip-gram model based on squared loss :cite:`Pennington.Socher.Manning.2014`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use variables $p'_{ij}=x_{ij}$ and $q'_{ij}=\\exp(\\mathbf{u}_j^\\top \\mathbf{v}_i)$\n",
    "that are not probability distributions\n",
    "and take the logarithm of both, so the squared loss term is $\\left(\\log\\,p'_{ij} - \\log\\,q'_{ij}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\mathbf{u}_j^\\top \\mathbf{v}_i - \\log\\,x_{ij}\\right)^2$.\n",
    "2. Add two scalar model parameters for each word $w_i$: the center word bias $b_i$ and the context word bias $c_i$.\n",
    "3. Replace the weight of each loss term with the weight function $h(x_{ij})$, where $h(x)$ is increasing in the interval of $[0, 1]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting all things together, training GloVe is to minimize the following loss function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sum_{i\\in\\mathcal{V}} \\sum_{j\\in\\mathcal{V}} h(x_{ij}) \\left(\\mathbf{u}_j^\\top \\mathbf{v}_i + b_i + c_j - \\log\\,x_{ij}\\right)^2.$$\n",
    ":eqlabel:`eq_glove-loss`\n",
    "\n",
    "For the weight function, a suggested choice is:\n",
    "$h(x) = (x/c) ^\\alpha$ (e.g $\\alpha = 0.75$) if $x < c$ (e.g., $c = 100$); otherwise $h(x) = 1$.\n",
    "In this case,\n",
    "because $h(0)=0$,\n",
    "the squared loss term for any $x_{ij}=0$ can be omitted\n",
    "for computational efficiency.\n",
    "For example,\n",
    "when using minibatch stochastic gradient descent for training,\n",
    "at each iteration\n",
    "we randomly sample a minibatch of *non-zero* $x_{ij}$\n",
    "to calculate gradients\n",
    "and update the model parameters.\n",
    "Note that these non-zero $x_{ij}$ are precomputed\n",
    "global corpus statistics;\n",
    "thus, the model is called GloVe\n",
    "for *Global Vectors*.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be emphasized that\n",
    "if word $w_i$ appears in the context window of\n",
    "word $w_j$, then *vice versa*.\n",
    "Therefore, $x_{ij}=x_{ji}$.\n",
    "Unlike word2vec\n",
    "that fits the asymmetric conditional probability\n",
    "$p_{ij}$,\n",
    "GloVe fits the symmetric $\\log \\, x_{ij}$.\n",
    "Therefore, the center word vector and\n",
    "the context word vector of any word are mathematically equivalent in the GloVe model.\n",
    "However in practice, owing to different initialization values,\n",
    "the same word may still get different values\n",
    "in these two vectors after training:\n",
    "GloVe sums them up as the output vector.\n",

    "* The skip-gram model can be interpreted using global corpus statistics such as word-word co-occurrence counts.\n",

    "## Exercises\n",

    "1. If words $w_i$ and $w_j$ co-occur in the same context window, how can we use their   distance in the text sequence to redesign the method for  calculating the conditional probability $p_{ij}$? Hint: see Section 4.2 of the GloVe paper :cite:`Pennington.Socher.Manning.2014`.\n",
