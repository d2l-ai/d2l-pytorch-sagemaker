    "We introduced how to run this book on AWS in :numref:`sec_sagemaker` and :numref:`sec_aws`. Another option is running this book on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), which provides free GPU if you have a Google account.\n",

    "To run a section on Colab, you can simply click the `Colab` button to the right of the title of that section, such as in :numref:`fig_colab`. \n",
