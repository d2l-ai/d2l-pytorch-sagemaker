    "Many deep learning applications require a significant amount of computation. Your local machine might be too slow to solve these problems in a reasonable amount of time. Cloud computing services give you access to more powerful computers to run the GPU-intensive portions of this book. This tutorial will guide you through Amazon SageMaker: a service that allows you to run this book easily.\n",

    "First, we need to register an account at https://aws.amazon.com/. We encourage you to use two-factor authentication for additional security. It is also a good idea to set up detailed billing and spending alerts to avoid any unexpected surprises in case you forget to stop any running instance.\n",
    "Note that you will need a credit card.\n",
