    "\n",
    "In :numref:`sec_linear_regression`, we introduced linear regression,\n",
    "working through implementations from scratch in :numref:`sec_linear_scratch`\n",
    "and again using high-level APIs of a deep learning framework\n",
    "in :numref:`sec_linear_concise` to do the heavy lifting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression is the hammer we reach for when\n",
    "we want to answer *how much?* or *how many?* questions.\n",
    "If you want to predict the number of dollars (price)\n",
    "at which a house will be sold,\n",
    "or the number of wins a baseball team might have,\n",
    "or the number of days that a patient will remain hospitalized before being discharged,\n",
    "then you are probably looking for a regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, we are more often interested in *classification*:\n",
    "asking not \"how much\" but \"which one\":\n",
    "\n",
    "* Does this email belong in the spam folder or the inbox?\n",
    "* Is this customer more likely *to sign up* or *not to sign up* for a subscription service?\n",
    "* Does this image depict a donkey, a dog, a cat, or a rooster?\n",

    "Colloquially, machine learning practitioners\n",
    "overload the word *classification*\n",
    "to describe two subtly different problems:\n",
    "(i) those where we are interested only in\n",

    "\n",
    "To get our feet wet, let us start off with\n",
    "a simple image classification problem.\n",
    "Here, each input consists of a $2\\times2$ grayscale image.\n",
    "We can represent each pixel value with a single scalar,\n",
    "giving us four features $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4$.\n",
    "Further, let us assume that each image belongs to one\n",
    "among the categories \"cat\", \"chicken\", and \"dog\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we have to choose how to represent the labels.\n",
    "We have two obvious choices.\n",
    "Perhaps the most natural impulse would be to choose $y \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$,\n",
    "where the integers represent $\\{\\text{dog}, \\text{cat}, \\text{chicken}\\}$ respectively.\n",
    "This is a great way of *storing* such information on a computer.\n",
    "If the categories had some natural ordering among them,\n",
    "say if we were trying to predict $\\{\\text{baby}, \\text{toddler}, \\text{adolescent}, \\text{young adult}, \\text{adult}, \\text{geriatric}\\}$,\n",
    "then it might even make sense to cast this problem as regression\n",
    "and keep the labels in this format.\n",
    "\n",
    "But general classification problems do not come with natural orderings among the classes.\n",
    "Fortunately, statisticians long ago invented a simple way\n",
    "to represent categorical data: the *one-hot encoding*.\n",
    "A one-hot encoding is a vector with as many components as we have categories.\n",
    "The component corresponding to particular instance's category is set to 1\n",
    "and all other components are set to 0.\n",
    "In our case, a label $y$ would be a three-dimensional vector,\n",
    "with $(1, 0, 0)$ corresponding to \"cat\", $(0, 1, 0)$ to \"chicken\",\n",
    "and $(0, 0, 1)$ to \"dog\":\n",

    "The main approach that we are going to take here\n",

    "We will optimize our parameters to produce probabilities\n",

    "\n",
    "Put formally, we would like any output $\\hat{y}_j$\n",
    "to be interpreted as the probability\n",
    "that a given item belongs to class $j$.\n",
    "Then we can choose the class with the largest output value\n",
    "as our prediction $\\operatorname*{argmax}_j y_j$.\n",
    "For example, if $\\hat{y}_1$, $\\hat{y}_2$, and $\\hat{y}_3$\n",
    "are 0.1, 0.8, and 0.1, respectively,\n",
    "then we predict category 2, which (in our example) represents \"chicken\".\n",
    "\n",
    "You might be tempted to suggest that we interpret\n",
    "the logits $o$ directly as our outputs of interest.\n",
    "However, there are some problems with directly\n",
    "interpreting the output of the linear layer as a probability.\n",
    "On one hand,\n",
    "nothing constrains these numbers to sum to 1.\n",
    "On the other hand, depending on the inputs, they can take negative values.\n",
    "These violate basic axioms of probability presented in :numref:`sec_prob`\n",
    "\n",
    "To interpret our outputs as probabilities,\n",
    "we must guarantee that (even on new data),\n",
    "they will be nonnegative and sum up to 1.\n",
    "Moreover, we need a training objective that encourages\n",
    "the model to estimate faithfully probabilities.\n",
    "Of all instances when a classifier outputs 0.5,\n",
    "we hope that half of those examples\n",
    "will actually belong to the predicted class.\n",

    "The *softmax function*, invented in 1959 by the social scientist\n",
    "R. Duncan Luce in the context of *choice models*,\n",
    "does precisely this.\n",
    "To transform our logits such that they become nonnegative and sum to 1,\n",
    "while requiring that the model remains differentiable,\n",
    "we first exponentiate each logit (ensuring non-negativity)\n",
    "and then divide by their sum (ensuring that they sum to 1):\n",

    "\n",
    "The central idea in information theory is to quantify the information content in data.\n",
    "This quantity places a hard limit on our ability to compress the data.\n",
    "In information theory, this quantity is called the *entropy* of a distribution $P$,\n",
    "and it is captured by the following equation:\n",

    "$$H[P] = \\sum_j - P(j) \\log P(j).$$\n",
    ":eqlabel:`eq_softmax_reg_entropy`\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the fundamental theorems of information theory states\n",
    "that in order to encode data drawn randomly from the distribution $P$,\n",
    "we need at least $H[P]$ \"nats\" to encode it.\n",
    "If you wonder what a \"nat\" is, it is the equivalent of bit\n",
    "but when using a code with base $e$ rather than one with base 2.\n",
    "Thus, one nat is $\\frac{1}{\\log(2)} \\approx 1.44$ bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Surprisal\n",
    "\n",
    "You might be wondering what compression has to do with prediction.\n",
    "Imagine that we have a stream of data that we want to compress.\n",
    "If it is always easy for us to predict the next token,\n",
    "then this data is easy to compress!\n",
    "Take the extreme example where every token in the stream always takes the same value.\n",
    "That is a very boring data stream!\n",
    "And not only it is boring, but it is also easy to predict.\n",
    "Because they are always the same, we do not have to transmit any information\n",
    "to communicate the contents of the stream.\n",
    "Easy to predict, easy to compress.\n",
    "\n",
    "However if we cannot perfectly predict every event,\n",
    "then we might sometimes be surprised.\n",
    "Our surprise is greater when we assigned an event lower probability.\n",
    "Claude Shannon settled on $\\log \\frac{1}{P(j)} = -\\log P(j)$\n",

    "having assigned it a (subjective) probability $P(j)$.\n",
    "The entropy defined in :eqref:`eq_softmax_reg_entropy` is then the *expected surprisal*\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* The softmax operation takes a vector and maps it into probabilities.\n",
    "* Softmax regression applies to classification problems. It uses the probability distribution of the output class in the softmax operation.\n",
    "* Cross-entropy is a good measure of the difference between two probability distributions. It measures the number of bits needed to encode the data given our model.\n",

    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We can explore the connection between exponential families and the softmax in some more depth.\n",
    "    1. Compute the second derivative of the cross-entropy loss $l(\\mathbf{y},\\hat{\\mathbf{y}})$ for the softmax.\n",
    "    1. Compute the variance of the distribution given by $\\mathrm{softmax}(\\mathbf{o})$ and show that it matches the second derivative computed above.\n",
    "1. Assume that we have three classes which occur with equal probability, i.e., the probability vector is $(\\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3})$.\n",
    "    1. What is the problem if we try to design a binary code for it?\n",
    "    1. Can you design a better code? Hint: what happens if we try to encode two independent observations? What if we encode $n$ observations jointly?\n",
    "1. Softmax is a misnomer for the mapping introduced above (but everyone in deep learning uses it). The real softmax is defined as $\\mathrm{RealSoftMax}(a, b) = \\log (\\exp(a) + \\exp(b))$.\n",
    "    1. Prove that $\\mathrm{RealSoftMax}(a, b) > \\mathrm{max}(a, b)$.\n",
    "    1. Prove that this holds for $\\lambda^{-1} \\mathrm{RealSoftMax}(\\lambda a, \\lambda b)$, provided that $\\lambda > 0$.\n",
    "    1. Show that for $\\lambda \\to \\infty$ we have $\\lambda^{-1} \\mathrm{RealSoftMax}(\\lambda a, \\lambda b) \\to \\mathrm{max}(a, b)$.\n",
    "    1. What does the soft-min look like?\n",
    "    1. Extend this to more than two numbers.\n",
