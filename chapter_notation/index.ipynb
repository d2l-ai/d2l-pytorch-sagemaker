    "Throughout this book, we adhere \n",
    "to the following notational conventions.\n",
    "Note that some of these symbols are placeholders,\n",
    "while others refer to specific objects.\n",
    "As a general rule of thumb, \n",
    "the indefinite article \"a\" often indicates\n",
    "that the symbol is a placeholder\n",
    "and that similarly formatted symbols\n",
    "can denote other objects of the same type.\n",
    "For example, \"$x$: a scalar\" means \n",
    "that lowercased letters generally\n",
    "represent scalar values,\n",
    "but \"$\\mathbb{Z}$: the set of integers\"\n",
    "refers specifically to the symbol $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n",
