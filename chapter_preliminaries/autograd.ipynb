    "While the calculations are straightforward,\n",

    "\n",
    "Fortunately all modern deep learning frameworks\n",
    "take this work off our plates\n",
    "by offering *automatic differentiation*\n",
    "(often shortened to *autograd*). \n",
    "As we pass data through each successive function,\n",
    "the framework builds a *computational graph* \n",

    "Here, tools from compilers and graph manipulation \n",
    "are leveraged to compute results \n",
    "in the most expedient and memory-efficient manner. \n",
    "\n",
    "For now, try to remember these basics: (i) attach gradients to those variables with respect to which we desire derivatives; (ii) record the computation of the target value; (iii) execute the backpropagation function; and  (iv) access the resulting gradient.\n",

    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Why is the second derivative much more expensive to compute than the first derivative?\n",
    "1. After running the function for backpropagation, immediately run it again and see what happens. Investigate.\n",
    "1. In the control flow example where we calculate the derivative of `d` with respect to `a`, what would happen if we changed the variable `a` to a random vector or a matrix? At this point, the result of the calculation `f(a)` is no longer a scalar. What happens to the result? How do we analyze this?\n",
    "1. Let $f(x) = \\sin(x)$. Plot the graph of $f$ and of its derivative $f'$. Do not exploit the fact that $f'(x) = \\cos(x)$ but rather use automatic differentiation to get the result. \n",
    "1. Let $f(x) = ((\\log x^2) \\cdot \\sin x) + x^{-1}$. Write out a dependency graph tracing results from $x$ to $f(x)$. \n",
    "1. Use the chain rule to compute the derivative $\\frac{df}{dx}$ of the aforementioned function, placing each term on the dependency graph that you constructed previously. \n",
    "1. Given the graph and the intermediate derivative results, you have a number of options when computing the gradient. Evaluate the result once starting from $x$ to $f$ and once from $f$ tracing back to $x$. The path from $x$ to $f$ is commonly known as *forward differentiation*, whereas the path from $f$ to $x$ is known as backward differentiation. \n",
    "1. When might you want to use forward, and when backward, differentiation? Hint: consider the amount of intermediate data needed, the ability to parallelize steps, and the size of matrices and vectors involved.\n"
