    "# Region-based CNNs (R-CNNs)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Region-based convolutional neural networks or regions with CNN features (R-CNNs)\n",
    "are a pioneering approach that applies deep models to object detection\n",
    ":cite:`Girshick.Donahue.Darrell.ea.2014`. In this section, we will discuss\n",
    "R-CNNs and a series of improvements made to them: Fast R-CNN\n",
    ":cite:`Girshick.2015`, Faster R-CNN :cite:`Ren.He.Girshick.ea.2015`, and Mask R-CNN\n",
    ":cite:`He.Gkioxari.Dollar.ea.2017`. Due to space limitations, we will confine\n",
    "our discussion to the designs of these models.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## R-CNNs\n",
    "\n",
    "R-CNN models first select several proposed regions from an image (for example,\n",
    "anchor boxes are one type of selection method) and then label their categories\n",
    "and bounding boxes (e.g., offsets). Then, they use a CNN to perform forward\n",
    "computation to extract features from each proposed area. Afterwards, we use the\n",
    "features of each proposed region to predict their categories and bounding\n",
    "boxes. :numref:`fig_r-cnn` shows an R-CNN model.\n",
    "\n",
    "![R-CNN model. ](../img/r-cnn.svg)\n",
    ":label:`fig_r-cnn`\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, R-CNNs are composed of four main parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Selective search is performed on the input image to select multiple\n",
    "   high-quality proposed regions\n",
    "   :cite:`Uijlings.Van-De-Sande.Gevers.ea.2013`. These proposed regions are\n",
    "   generally selected on multiple scales and have different shapes and\n",
    "   sizes. The category and ground-truth bounding box of each proposed region is\n",
    "   labeled.\n",
    "1. A pretrained CNN is selected and placed, in truncated form, before the\n",
    "   output layer. It transforms each proposed region into the input dimensions\n",
    "   required by the network and uses forward computation to output the features\n",
    "   extracted from the proposed regions.\n",
    "1. The features and labeled category of each proposed region are combined as an\n",
    "   example to train multiple support vector machines for object\n",
    "   classification. Here, each support vector machine is used to determine\n",
    "   whether an example belongs to a certain category.\n",
    "1. The features and labeled bounding box of each proposed region are combined as\n",
    "   an example to train a linear regression model for ground-truth bounding box\n",
    "   prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although R-CNN models use pretrained CNNs to effectively extract image\n",
    "features, the main downside is the slow speed. As you can imagine, we can select\n",
    "thousands of proposed regions from a single image, requiring thousands of\n",
    "forward computations from the CNN to perform object detection. This massive\n",
    "computing load means that R-CNNs are not widely used in actual applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fast R-CNN\n",
    "\n",
    "The main performance bottleneck of an R-CNN model is the need to independently\n",
    "extract features for each proposed region. As these regions have a high degree\n",
    "of overlap, independent feature extraction results in a high volume of\n",
    "repetitive computations. Fast R-CNN improves on the R-CNN by only performing CNN\n",
    "forward computation on the image as a whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Fast R-CNN model. ](../img/fast-rcnn.svg)\n",
    ":label:`fig_fast_r-cnn`\n",
    "\n",
    ":numref:`fig_fast_r-cnn` shows a Fast R-CNN model. Its primary computation\n",
    "steps are described below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Compared to an R-CNN model, a Fast R-CNN model uses the entire image as the\n",
    "   CNN input for feature extraction, rather than each proposed region. Moreover,\n",
    "   this network is generally trained to update the model parameters. As the\n",
    "   input is an entire image, the CNN output shape is $1 \\times c \\times h_1\n",
    "   \\times w_1$.\n",
    "1. Assuming selective search generates $n$ proposed regions, their different\n",
    "   shapes indicate regions of interests (RoIs) of different shapes on the CNN\n",
    "   output. Features of the same shapes must be extracted from these RoIs (here\n",
    "   we assume that the height is $h_2$ and the width is $w_2$). Fast R-CNN\n",
    "   introduces RoI pooling, which uses the CNN output and RoIs as input to output\n",
    "   a concatenation of the features extracted from each proposed region with the\n",
    "   shape $n \\times c \\times h_2 \\times w_2$.\n",
    "1. A fully connected layer is used to transform the output shape to $n \\times\n",
    "   d$, where $d$ is determined by the model design.\n",
    "1. During category prediction, the shape of the fully connected layer output is\n",
    "   again transformed to $n \\times q$ and we use softmax regression ($q$ is the\n",
    "   number of categories). During bounding box prediction, the shape of the fully\n",
    "   connected layer output is again transformed to $n \\times 4$. This means that\n",
    "   we predict the category and bounding box for each proposed region.\n",
    "\n",
    "The RoI pooling layer in Fast R-CNN is somewhat different from the pooling\n",
    "layers we have discussed before. In a normal pooling layer, we set the pooling\n",
    "window, padding, and stride to control the output shape. In an RoI pooling\n",
    "layer, we can directly specify the output shape of each region, such as\n",
    "specifying the height and width of each region as $h_2, w_2$. Assuming that the\n",
    "height and width of the RoI window are $h$ and $w$, this window is divided into\n",
    "a grid of sub-windows with the shape $h_2 \\times w_2$. The size of each\n",
    "sub-window is about $(h/h_2) \\times (w/w_2)$. The sub-window height and width\n",
    "must always be integers and the largest element is used as the output for a\n",
    "given sub-window. This allows the RoI pooling layer to extract features of the\n",
    "same shape from RoIs of different shapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In :numref:`fig_roi`, we select an $3\\times 3$ region as an RoI of the $4 \\times\n",
    "4$ input. For this RoI, we use a $2\\times 2$ RoI pooling layer to obtain a\n",
    "single $2\\times 2$ output. When we divide the region into four sub-windows, they\n",
    "respectively contain the elements 0, 1, 4, and 5 (5 is the largest); 2 and 6 (6\n",
    "is the largest); 8 and 9 (9 is the largest); and 10.\n",
